The cotton team has developed several libraries and APIs for fabric minecraft modding. Most of them are bundled and easily available as a single download, however, some of the bigger libraries need to be downloaded independently.
To install them you need to download the correct version from curseforge and put it into you mods folder.

**_ALL these mods require Fabric API!_**

## Cotton

The main cotton mod contains cauldron, config, datapack, logging, and player-events
