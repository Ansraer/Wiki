Cotton Resources provides mod authors with a selection of different blocks and items that are commonly used. We did all the work for you, there are finished high-quality textures, incredibly structured JSON files and stunning crafting recipes. Even ore gen is handled by us.

Cotton Resources will make sure that copper_ingot and some default recipes will be added to minecraft. You can now access it in your json files (e.g. crafting recipes) by using `c:copper_ingot`.
