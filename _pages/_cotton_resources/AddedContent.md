Here is a list of all blocks and items we currently support. This is an ever-growing list, so make sure to check back frequently.

## Base Materials

| ResourceType | Name    | Description | Since Version |
|--------------|---------|-------------|---------------|
| coal      | coal_dust  | Needed for graphite and possibly steel | v.0.0.1 |
| coal_coke | coal_coke  | Good second-tier power gen option | v.0.0.1 |
|           | coal_coke_block | | |
| mercury   | mercury    | great for magical applications, and in the ancient world was incorrectly thought to keep one healthy when drank - see also the Pythagorean Cup | v.0.0.1 |
| uranium   | uranium_dust | Uranium and its byproducts can make a really great high-risk/high-reward/high-tier energy system | v.0.0.1 |
| plutonium | plutonium_dust | Plutonium can't be found in a rock in any decent quantity anywhere. It's a byproduct of uranium fission, but plutonium fission is more energetic, making it a second-tier nuclear fuel capable of decaying back into uranium. | v.0.0.1 |
| thorium   | thorium_dust   | Thorium, found rarely in monazite deposits, can start several fission chains either burning it out, or "breeding" upwards into fissionable uranium or plutonium. It can occasionally be obtained from random decay of uranium and plutonium. | v.0.0.1 |
| copper | copper_ingot  | Copper's a great low-tier conductor for both heat and electricity. Its high ductility is the reason we think of wires as flexible. Corrodes easily. | v.0.0.1 |
|        | copper_nugget | | |
|        | copper_dust   | | |
|        | copper_block  | | |
| silver | silver_ingot  | Silver is corrosion resistant, and is a better conductor - both heat and electricity - than copper and gold. Rare, and loaded with magical lore. | v.0.0.1 |
|        | silver_nugget | | |
|        | silver_dust   | | |
|        | silver_block  | | |
| lead   | lead_ingot    | Lead is synonymous with heavy and slow. Used for irrigation pipes in the ancient world, also used to sink fishing bait, to plumb quality architecture, and for drywall or concrete anchors. | v.0.0.1 |
|        | lead_nugget   | | |
|        | lead_dust     | | |
|        | lead_block    | | |
| zinc   | zinc_ingot    | Zinc is a secondary product of many ores, and is a key ingredient in brass. Zinc is insanely easy to corrode, to the point where they attach zinc blocks to oil rigs to keep them from rusting. | v.0.0.1 |
|        | zinc_nugget   | | |
|        | zinc_dust     | | |
|        | zinc_block    | | |

## Steels and Alloys

| ResourceType | Name | Description | Composition | Since Version |
|--------------|------|-------------|-------------|---------------|
| steel    | steel_ingot      | Steel has excellent tensile strength, good for mid- to high-tier tools, structures, and machines | 1 iron_ingot + 4 coal_dust? = 1 steel_ingot | v.0.0.1 |
|          | steel_nugget | | | |
|          | steel_dust   | | | |
|          | steel_block  | | | |
| electrum | electrum_ingot   | Electrum is a soft metal, not appropriate for heavy machinery, but is a corrosion-resistant conductor. It was also used to top obelisks and pyramids in ancient Egypt. | 1 gold_ingot + 1 silver_ingot = 2 electrum_ingot | v.0.0.1 |
|          | electrum_nugget | | | |
|          | electrum_dust   | | | |
|          | electrum_block  | | | |
| brass    | brass_ingot      | Brass has excellent corrosion resistance and low friction, making it great for clockwork and pneumatics, instruments, and naval applications | 3 copper_ingot + 1 zinc_ingot = 4 brass_ingot | v.0.0.1 |
|          | brass_nugget | | |
|          | brass_dust   | | |
|          | brass_block  | | |
