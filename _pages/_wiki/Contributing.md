Hey there, glad to see that you have decided to contribute to this wiki! 

It's really easy, all you have to do is to visit [this](https://github.com/CottonMC/Wiki) github project. This entire website is built directly on github using github pages, so by adding or changing stuff in the master branch of the github project you can contribute to this site.

## Building the site on your PC
The github pages site is automatically updated after each commit. However, if you want to test changes locally you will need to install jekyll on your PC.

1.  Start by openiong bash and making sure that you have ruby installed:
    ```bash
    $ ruby --version
    > ruby 2.X.X
    ```
    If you don't have ruby installed installed, install [Ruby 2.1.0 or higher](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/).

2.  Install bundler:
    ```bash
    $ gem install bundler
    ```

3.  Navigate to the project directory and install all the necessary dependencies:
    ```bash
    $ bundle install
    > Fetching gem metadata from https://rubygems.org/............
    > Fetching version metadata from https://rubygems.org/...
    > Fetching dependency metadata from https://rubygems.org/..
    > Resolving dependencies...
    ```

4.  Run the wiki site locally:
    ```bash
    $ bundle exec jekyll serve
    ```

5. Open the site in your browser: [http://localhost:4000/Wiki/](http://localhost:4000/Wiki/)

## Adding a site
All these pages are autogenerated from markdown files in the _pages directory. So to add a page all you have to do is to create a md file in the subfolder of the category you want to add it to.
Each Markdown file needs to start with the following lines:
