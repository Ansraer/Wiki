# Welcome?

This is supposed to be a private wiki. How did you get here?

# Disclaimer

I created this project for two reasons. The first was that I knew that I would need something like this for other projects in the future. So writing a jekyll based wiki system seemed like something that would pay of sooner or later. The second was that I had already started to write down my experiences working with the Fabric project, as I always do when I want to properly learn how to use an api, and I wanted to have a place where I could organize my notes and make it easier to access them for future reference. This "wiki" is the result of these efforts. It was never intended to be seen by anyone other than me, but if you are reading this that is obviously no longer true.
On the following pages, I make quite a few jokes about fellow developers, some of which might be perceived as rude or insulting (I have a somewhat twisted sense of humor and sometimes have trouble not crossing certain lines). This was never my intention. I have the utmost respect for all the people I mention, all of them are better and more experienced developers than me.

Should you feel offended by something I wrote please, **PLEASE**, let me know. Insulting or offending someone was the last thing I planned when I created this wiki/blog/whatever and I will do my best to fix the problem.
